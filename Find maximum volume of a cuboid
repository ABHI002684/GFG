/*
You are given a perimeter & the area. Your task is to return the maximum volume that can be made in the form of a cuboid from the given perimeter and surface area.
Note: Round off to 2 decimal places and for the given parameters, it is guaranteed that an answer always exists.

Examples
Input: perimeter = 22, area = 15
Output: 3.02
Explanation: The maximum attainable volume of the cuboid is 3.02

Input: perimeter = 20, area = 5
Output: 0.33
Explanation: The maximum attainable volume of the cuboid is 0.33

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints :
1 ≤ perimeter ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ area ≤ 10^9
